## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth animations for page transitions and list items
clsx | Utility for conditional class names (usually standard but good to be explicit)
tailwind-merge | Utility for merging tailwind classes

## Notes
Authentication uses session cookies (credentials: include).
Image uploads use FormData and POST /api/uploads.
Google Drive integration is handled by the backend; frontend just sends the file.
Mobile-first design approach with 'sm:' breakpoints for larger screens.
